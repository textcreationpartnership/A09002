            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The like neceſſitie doth compell, the preſent publiſhing hereof, to avoyde the ſcandall which may ariſe, by a large anſwere, penned to the firſt papers, which were ſcribled out by the Author in few dayes, and are not the true copie to which he doth ſlande: In which reſpect I hope the Author will not be offended hereat, when it ſhall come to his knowledge, though he were altogether vnwilling it ſhould paſſe into the handes of his frindes for ſo publick a purpoſe. And to thee good Reader I doubt not but it ſhall bee very acceptable, for the great learning, acutenes, modeſtie, fidelitie and ſufficiencie thou ſhalt finde therein: It containing a full anſwere to whatſoeuer hath bene materially obiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Prelates, or any of their Champions in d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<note place="margin">Auguſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de Genefi. ad liter. lib. 10. c. 26</note> and what are my grounds and reaſons. To this purpoſe I addreſſed a certayne Treatiſe (ſuch as it was) againſt the <hi>Croſſe:</hi> which I imparted to ſome of my friends: either to haue their cenſure of it, or to approoue my ſelfe vnto them in my forbearance to conforme. This being copied out by ſome (who I know not) was made more co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon then I would: and that vnliked, &amp; more vnfaſhioned, then might be for my credit. By this meanes I was inforced to take penne in hande againe, &amp; to frame this ſorie <hi>Treatiſe:</hi> as to ſet right what before was out of ſquare, ſo to poliſh (as I was able) what was vnfyled, and to take in (by ſome additions) ſome things that wanted. Now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I doe not know, into whoſe handes this poore labour of myne may come: therefore I begge of the indifferent Reader, to take knowledge before hande from me of theſe fewe things. Firſt, let none thinke me to be one that ſtandeth vpon termes of learning: I am too much priuie to ouermuch ignorance: I know well (although not ſo well as I ſhould) <hi>quàm mihi ſit curta ſupellex:</hi> beſides I want bookes and conference, and my Schoole ſtudies haue ben long diſcontinued. In regard hereof I am to craue common humanitie at the leaſt, which is to read my abortiue ouerſightes with due compaſſion: ſome of which I haue my ſelfe alreadie found: as Malta miſtaken out of <hi>Surius</hi> for Nilenus: <hi>Nazianzen</hi> forgotten in Germanes alluſion, and the time of the German triple Crowne, not ſo diſtinctly ſet down as it ſhould. Secondly, as I doe not ſtande vpon any chalenge to learning at all, ſo neither doe I ſtande peremptorilie, vpon the aſſertions of this Treatiſe (not as if I doubted of what I haue written, whether it be true or not) but becauſe my determination is no more, then to ſuppone and propound the reaſons which I haue againſt the Ceremonies, and that <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis cauſae</hi> onlie, by way of diſputation.

Now of the ſame linnadge is the difference of our Oppoſits betweene the materiall and myſticall Croſſe; that of the Rood-loft, and this of the Font, the Croſſe, of the Supper, and this of Baptiſme; If hee were not ill, why was he remoued? If this be good, how is he ill? Seeing like the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:15726:26"/>former Images by Papiſts diſtinguiſhed prepoſterouſly, they be of one kind, and differ onely in little and great, to graunt the moſt that can be ſuppoſed. Now this difference excuſeth not in any one commandement, becauſe he that forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth robbery, forbiddeth ſtealing: and he that forbiddeth adultery, forbiddeth fornication: and hee that forbiddeth ſlaying, forbiddeth mayming:
<note place="margin">Iam. 2.10.</note> nor yet in diuerſe commandements neither, becauſe he that breaketh the leaſt is guilty of the greateſt, for that he diſobeyeth him that gaue them all. Very fit for this purpoſe are the words of <hi>Hierome,</hi>

See we not from hence how little ſeruice this our coyned diſtinction doth vs? For as in the bodily adulterie it is the mind that is reſpected: whether the harlot be faire or foule, rich or poore, it skilleth not: So in the ſpirituall it is the honour that maketh guilty, and not the Idoll, whether he be materiall or aereall, permanent or tranſeunt, painted or gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, cunningly drawne or botcherly made, poore or bedecked with Iewels. So in the Scripture, the popiſh Idols, whether they be of wood or of gold, they are all one: &amp; the Images of the heathen are throwne all of them into one heap,

what though the materiall Croſſes done away by our Church, were euery way worſe?

But they, from whom? why (thinke ye) they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend any imitation of the papiſtes? no, they impoſe them out of policie (as rites of order) for the Churches good.

For this is not onely the common plea for the ceremonies now<note n="r" place="margin">Examin. of the decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat of the Miniſters of Lond.</note> adayes, but euen at firſt, when as Maiſter <hi>Hooker</hi>

Surceaſe we then this ſubſtitution, or ceaſe we to charg the papiſtes for the like: as their ſubſtituting of<note n="z" place="margin">Ioh.

For when they recite what doth make an Image holy, and a Croſſe, they<note n="b" place="margin">Suar. tom. 1. in.

In which who heareth not the very ſound of our home pulpits? which declaime before the people how ancient the ſigne of the Croſſe is: How much reckoning the Fathers made of it? What miracles God hath wroght by it? &amp; how devoutly our Church hath ſanctified it to be a meane whereby to dedicate our ſeede to him that dyed vpon the tree therof? But they ſay that the Croſſe hath power againſt Sathan<note n="c" place="margin">Ibid. diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>put. 56. ſect. 3.</note>

Secondly, how neare are we to the right hand of fellowſhip with them in the condition of the Croſſes holines, ſeeing they well neare agree with vs in what we ſpeake againſt it, we with them in what they ſpeake for it.

Indeed a<note n="p" place="margin">Vazq de adorat. li. 3. diſput. 2. cap. 6.</note> Ieſuite himſelfe will yeeld that as the Croſſe is conſidered to be but an inſtrument of the paine of Chriſt his death, that ſo hee ought to bee as deteſtable vnto vs, as the gibbet is to a child which was the inſtrument of his Fathers infamous hanging. And what other conſideration will our religion allow in the Croſſe ſaue this alone? For whereas the Papiſtes count him holy, as an inſtrument of our redemption which was merited by the paine to which the Croſſe did put him, we totally denie that he may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered ſo. Affirming that the Croſſe was onely vſed for paine and curſe that of the redemption which came by this curſe and paine he was no inſtrument at all, vpon no other ground ſaue this continue we ſtill the ancient argument of the<note n="q" place="margin">Vid Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm. de Imag. cap. 16.</note> 
                           <hi>Petrobruſiani</hi> the croſſe ought to be as odious vnto vs as is the Gallouſe to a child on which his Father hanged. Thirdly, we come too neare the ſocietie of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtes in the act of the Croſſes holineſſe: which is ſo vile, that it is a fault euen a louſe off to follow them. For a man to Croſſe himſelfe, it is with them,<note n="r" place="margin">Guilhel. Wideford. a dverſ. Wickleph. a rt. 10.</note>

The more is it to bee lamented that euen in the middeſt of our owne Church ſome ſhould ariſe, to renewe a great part of this his credit.

But the Apoſtle (ſay our Oppoſites) the 15. act. 28 called the things [neceſſary] which they commaunded being of themſelues but things in different.

If thou haſt made a ſeperation, thou haſt made a faire hand: this very ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration maketh the Croſſe to be a ſigne of a diuerſe <hi>ſpecies,</hi> and ſo by conſequent to be an addition that is vnlawfull. And the manner of this ſeparation (boaſted of) maketh the after place of the Croſſe yet worſe. For, there being a word ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralled to it, ſuch (for ſhew) as the water hath, occaſion is giuen to the ſimple to imagine, that the water and Croſſe in Baptiſme are of the ſame <hi>ſequence and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence</hi> too, that the bread and wine are in the Lords Supper. Indeed what hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth? For what though the Croſſe and the water be diuerſe in matter? So are the bread and the wine in the Supper. They make one refection in Chriſt, and ſo grow to be<note n="n" place="margin">Aquin. p. 3 qu 73. art. 2. ad 2.</note> formally one, theſe may grow to be one likewiſe, becauſe they make formerly one, inueſting into the Church. And doth not the Croſſe touch the water as neare as the wine doth touch the bread? The poſtation of the wine doth not preiudice it, therefore the poſtponing of the Croſſe doth not preiudice it neither. A ſeperation of ſo ſmall diſtance waggeth no corne, it caſteth the Croſſe behinde the water, but not below it. Neuer thought the auncient Chriſtians there was a ſufficient ſeperation betweene them and the Iewes, till the ſolemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties themſelues did differ on<note n="o" place="margin">Concil. Laodicen. cap. 29. Irenaeus li. 1 ca. 26. Epiphan. haereſ. 30.</note> diuerſe dayes. So that, as long as the Croſſe and the water, our Croſſe and the popiſh, are ſeene in the ſame ſolemnitie of Baptiſme, the ſeperation is inſufficient. Thirdly, ſo farre is it that the Croſſe commeth after Baptiſme, thereby to be made morally at the leaſt no part thereof, that it hath in fight the chiefeſt roume and ſeat of credit, which the adminiſtration of this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament can afford.

For they vſurpe the office of the Holy Ghoſt, by whoſe iudgement ſome things are ordained to be figures of other things; and they vilifie the ſacred Sripture, while by ſuch fiction they giue occaſion to beleeue that the things which are in the Scripture, are figurs by humane ſpirit, euen as theſe which they haue framed by the dexteritie of humane wit, ſo much authoritie is detracted fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the figures of the holy Scripture.

One maine ground of this doctrine is mainly refuſed (I knowe) by the<note n="d" place="margin">Bellar. de ſacram. in gen. ca. 21. propoſit. 2</note> papiſtes, which is that no man may deuiſe any worſhip of God: and another ground is brought in place (to wit) the Sacraments of the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament do giue grace and none can giue grace but God only: And therfore none ordaine a ſigne but God alone. How neare our Oppoſites come to this Ieſuit, all men may knowe who heare them diſtinguiſhe, though a man may not deuiſe an exhibitiue ſigne, yet hee may deuiſe a ſignificatiue, one ſuch as is the ſigne of the Croſſe. Alas to what poore ſhiftes are theſe men driuen! For we haue heard out of the ſchoole men already that God is the only ſignifier both in things and in

Why, as it is<note n="f" place="margin">Andre.

Alas, thou muſt conſider how playfull they were in their
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:15726:58"/>ſignifications. and thou mayeſt eaſilie ſee from hence what litle hurt it is to looſe the fonde figures they haue deuiſed.</p>
                        <p>The ſecond ſigne added by man (which our Oppoſites do alleadge) is the <hi>Altar</hi> of <hi>Iordan</hi> bancke. The altar of the two Tribes and an halfe was lawfully added to the Altar of the Temple (ſay they) therefore the Church may lawfully adde the ſigne of the Croſſe to the water of Baptiſme. Firſt let me reaſon a litle better: The Altar like to that of <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> was added vnlawfully in the Temple: and the Altar of the high places was an vnlawfull addition likewiſe: therfore the addition of the ſigne of the Croſſe to the ſigne of the water, is vnlawfull altogether. Secondly, who lamenteth not to ſee how groſſe our Oppoſites are growne? For what cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in this argument, what coincidence in theſe two ſignes? For neither was the Altar of the two Tribes in ſtate religious as the Croſſe is, nor in vſe. it was ciuill in the iudgement of the moſt<note n="g" place="margin">D. Babing. in the 2. co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                              <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> learned of our Oppoſites. Or if it were to an holy vſe, yet not to the ſame for which the Altar of the temple ſerued. The Tribes had ſinned (ſay our<note n="h" place="margin">Ludouic. Lauater. in Ioſu. 22: homil. 61.</note> writers) if out of the Temple they had determined an Altar to the ſame vſe, for which the Lord had ſet vp one in the Temple already. And ſith it was out of the temple, it was not in ſtate religious like the Croſſe. What if it were? It had bene but like the Altar which Salomon reared, when Moſes Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar could not beare all the ſacrifices that were brought. From this Altar it is, that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> argueth a great deale more ſtrongly, then our Oppoſites from the other of Iordan banke. The addition of an new Altar added by Salomon, was lawfull (ſaith he) therefore additions of men are lawfull to the worſhipps of God. How doe we anſwer him? Firſt, this was done vpon ſpeciall warrant, as Salomon was a Prophet who had extraordinarie inſpiration (ſay ſome<note n="l" place="margin">Matt. Sut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cliue cont. Bellar. de ſummo Po<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                              <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tific. lib. 4. cap. 6.</note> of our writers) and from theſe it will followe againſt Bellarmine and our Oppoſites, that there is no war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant ordinarie in the worde to adde in any religious vſe, either Altar, Croſſe, or any ſigne elſe. Secondly, this Altar was added out of the equitie, euen of Moſes law it ſelfe (ſay<note n="m" place="margin">Franc. Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſ. 3. lib. 4. cap. 17. nota 4.</note> others) neither was it any addition at all, ſeeing no newe ſigne of a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe kinde. Theſe put this anſwere into our mouthes: The Altar of Iordan was no ſuch addition, in reſpect of the kinde, as is the addition of the Croſſe which is a new ſigne, of a diuerſe <hi>ſpecies</hi> from the water, to which he is added. Another Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar is ſet by the old, to this anſweres not a Croſſe, ſet by the water but two Fontes of water, ſet one by the other, when one of them doeth not ſuffice, that which in deed is no addition. Thirdly, (and laſt of all) either our Oppoſites haue very bad happe, or elſe they cannot ſpeake one ſyllable ſaue out of the popiſh, or Lutheran Grammar. They thinke it much when they are able to ſaye, that our Croſſe ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth only for a memoriall (euen as this Altar did) but a papiſt fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this place, ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth as honeſtly, as they for their liues. The ſigne of the Croſſe (ſaith<note n="n" place="margin">And. Mae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fius in Ioſ. 22.28.</note> he) is like this Altar, which the Church propoſeth to vs, not that wee ſhould adore it, but that we ſhould remember the Altar, whereon our Prieſt (according to <hi>Melchizo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deches</hi> order) offered him ſelfe, as a ſacrifice for vs. And they thinke they haue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſeth their Croſſe ſufficiently from being popiſh, when they haue ſaid, <hi>we vſe him not to the ſame ende, but in a diuer ſe manner.</hi> But there is a<note n="o" place="margin">Dauid Chytre in hunc locſi.</note> Lutheran, that ſpeaketh as ſtrongly, and as honeſtly for the Images of his Church: <hi>As here the Tribes</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>being challenged about this Altar,</hi> make anſwere, they ſet him not vp for ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, but to another ende: ſo when the <hi>Iconomachi</hi> challenge vs about our Images, we may well excuſe out ſelues in the like manner: <hi>Wee doe not ſett them vp to adore them, as papiſtes doe, but we vſe them for monuments only.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The third ſigne added by man, which our Oppoſites doe alleadge, is the ſigne of the Croſſe added to the Sacrament of the Paſſeouer, for as much as it appeareth by<note n="p" place="margin">Iuſtinus Martyr in Tryphon.</note> 
                           <hi>Iuſtinus Martyr,</hi> the <hi>Paſchall Lambe was roſted in the forme of a Croſſe.</hi> One of my brethren hearing of this, ſaid, that he had often heard of a tale of a roſted horſe,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:15726:58"/>but neuer of a roſted Croſſe before. This reply will ſerue the turne. For either the Paſchall Lambe was not dreſſed in forme of a Croſſe, or if it were, it was no <hi>typus deſtinatus:</hi> or if it were, it was inſtituted from the beginning.</p>

is the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of handes. why ſhould not the ſigne of the Croſſe be as lawfull as it (ſay they). Firſt, as our writers anſwer the Papiſtes <hi>impoſition of handes,</hi> in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles times was a ſigne, but not a ſacrament, ſo we anſwer our adverſe brethren.

Thirdly, whereas the Catechized had the handes laide on them before they were baptized, and thereby were receiued into the Church, though ſome differences may be alleadged betweene the ſigne of the croſſe and it, yet we holde it ſuperſtitious like the Croſſe which was made in it, and with whom it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe, for the higheſt mentioner of it is<note n="a" place="margin">Concil: Carthag. ſenten. 37.</note>

                           <hi>Areopagita</hi> who cannot be more auncient.

The fift ſigne added by man is the <hi>[Oſculum pacis]</hi> which was vſed in the primitiue Church. Which ſeeing it was lawfully added to the Sacrament of the Supper, why may not the Croſſe (a like ſigne vnto it) be adiected vnto Baptiſm? Firſt, this went<note n="d" place="margin">Iuſti.

Secondly, this was a meere naturall ſigne of peace, and not ſymbolicall or ſacramentall. all the people of the earth vſe to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace, and to ſtrike handes, and to kiſſe, when they will ſhew forth indicant ſignes of peace and reconciliation. Two men that were enemies ioyne handes together in the Church before they goe to the communion table in token of reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ciliation. will you make a ſacramentall ſigne of this? or will you ſay it is an addition to the ſacrament or affirme the ſigne of the Croſſe is no worſe, nor no more an addition then it? but now the kiſſe of the primitiue Church was ſuch: men ioyned hands in it: men embraced one another in it; as<note n="f" place="margin">Chryſoſt. ad popul.

Compare theſe with the wordes of the Croſſe to which they haue relation, yea which they repeate, and whereby the infant was receyued: and tell me whether the Booke doeth not incorporate the ſigne of the Croſſe into the Sacramentall actions: ſeeinge this, it combyneth and knittes it to them both, <hi>à priori</hi> and <hi>à poſteriori,</hi> as it were with a couple of ſtrong cordes,

Fiftly, our common<note n="w" place="margin">Ibid. p. 45</note> obiection againſt the Papiſtes is, that their Sainctes, Images and Croſſes had ſtore of miracles when they had no neede, and when there was none, that did impugne them but want miracles nowe a dayes at, greateſt neede, when ſo manie riſe vp againſt them. Againſt this there ariſe in the middeſt of vs, who ſett a broach even moderne miracles for the Croſſe. As a Father (ſayeth one) wiſhing his childe had bene croſſe in the ſeate of natures impuritie, had a next childe borne without vent there. Firſt let the time be conſidered when this miracle is ronge, which was gratefull to the papiſtes of thoſe partes, to backe a former miracle of theirs about the Crucifixe.

Secondly, let the perſon of the Father be conſidered, vpon whom it is fathered. For how could the proclaymer hereof either better revenge himſelfe, then to ſet him vpon the ſtage, who ſtopt at home his popiſh leavene, &amp; detected abroade many of his badde proceedings; or gratifie better his frindes of the other ſide, then to make him a ſpectacle of Gods Iudgement in the Croſſes reveng, who had before made himſelfe odious to them, all by ſervice effectually performed in the apprehenſion of diuerſe of them?

                        <p>VVE haue diſcouered (as wee are able) the hipocriſies of the Croſſe,
as they ſhewe themſelues in generall ſort, ouer all the powers of mans ſoule: now ſee we ſome ſpeciall obiectes, wherein they budde and bloſſom forth. particularly ſuch as is prayer firſt, and then our common converſation, concerning the former: The auncient crowne, of the Croſſes commendation, was wont to be this; that it ſerued as a ſtone of <hi>Horeb</hi> to helpe to hold vp the handes in prayer, of which pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er it was a<note n="a" place="margin">Perek. problem. pag. 84.</note> geſture; but the hypocriſies of it now, hath laid this honour in the duſte.

The Canons of the Apoſtles of Chriſt excommunicated him, that folemnized his Eaſter vppon the fourteenth day of the moneth like to the Iewes. and ſo doe the Councilles. A contrarie day to make vnlike vnto the Iewes was thought to be fitt and convenient by all. In ſo much that the <hi>Audaeani</hi> and <hi>Quartadecima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni</hi> were cenſured for heretiques, that did concurre in the ſame day with them. When certaine Countries in the Eaſt did the like, how did <hi>Constantine</hi> take on a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them? Further yet: Doe the Iewes reſt on a Saterday?

                  <p>CChriſtian Reader, I muſt advertiſe thee, that, either through the negligence of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or for want of a diligent Correctour, many faults haue eſcaped in the printing of this Booke. Diverſe of them are very groſſe, and do quite marre the ſenſe of the place, which I would pray thee to amend with thy Pen, before thou beginne to reade. As for the reſt which bee but literall, I would intreat thee in loue to pardon them, or to correct them as thou readeſt. Amongſt other things, I thinke it not amiſſe, here in this place, to admoniſh thee of one in particular, namely that the figures ſet to number the pages are very faultily ſet; after the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber 120. there following the number 129.130. and ſo on forward, till thou come to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber 135. and after that there beginning againe the number 128.129, &amp;c. from which number 128. till thou come to the number 136. I am conſtrained in the Table to ad to the number of the page, the letter and page of the ſheete: for example, pa. 128. Q. p. 129. R. and ſo in the reſt: which I thought good to let thee vnderſtand, leſt thou ſhouldeſt be miſtaken in ſeeking for any thing contained in this Table.</p>

                           <hi>maiora lucra</hi> to be hoped for.

This daunger will be preuented, if the weake brethren, who are likely to be offended, and to iudge that we omit them of contempt, be fully inſtructed in the whole matter: that ſo they may vnderſtand, that we doe not omit them, for anie co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tempt of publique authoritie, but for other iuſt cauſes. Our Reverend Fathers I truſt wilbe contented with that meaſure which themſelues meate to the Lord, but behold we afforde them better. The diſhonour of the Lord (ſay they) in the vſe of the croſſe will be ſufficiently preve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted, by the Miniſters preaching, but farr better (ſay we) may the Magiſtrates diſhonour be prevented, by the Miniſters preaching, and all other hurt that may followe his diſvſe, becauſe his preaching againſt contempt and irreverence of the lawe, is more vnderſtandable, remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, approuable, then his preaching againſt the abuſe &amp; ſuperſtition of the croſſe, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he doth vſe it: which is ſeldome vnderſtood by the people for the hardnes, regarded for the ſhewe which it hath of preciſenes, obeyed for the harſhnes, in that it ouertwhattly croſſeth their old inveterate cuſtome of croſſing. Secondly, the hurt that enſueth vpon the diſvſe of the ceremonies is leſſe, becauſe it may be more eaſilie remedied in that authoritie (if at any time it be defaced) hath power in her handes to right it ſelfe, whereas the hurt of the croſſe, as long as the croſſe it ſelfe remayneth, admitteth no remedie. Thirdly, in the hurt that commeth of the ceremonies there is <hi>[amplius detrimenti]</hi> to wit, the loſſe of the pretious ſoules of men, more worth then a world. For theſe Chriſt Ieſus loſt his life: will not our Reverend Fathers (then) looſe one jott of their authoritie, nor forbeare ſo much
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:15726:124"/>as a ceremonie, that is hurtfull vnto them? then if any not repenting heare at his comming, <hi>thy life ſhall goe for his life, and thy Soule for his Soule: yea as his ſoule was vile in thyne eyes, ſo ſhall thy ſoule be in mine.</hi>

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:15726:128"/>others hotly contending, they are moſt convenient, and ſo apt for edification. And of the former, there are three pathes, which they chooſe to them ſelves in the courſe of their conformitie. The firſt ſorte of them ſtande on this, though a thing <hi>per ſe</hi> vnlawfull, can never be done without offence, yet that things inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient may be yeelded too without tranſgreſſion. The firſt ſcripture which I know alleadged for this (to wit the 1. Cor. 6.12. <hi>All things are lawfull, but al things are not expedient,</hi> maketh more againſt them, then any ſcripture that I know, and that in <hi>Pet.

For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though many things be lawfull of them ſelues, yet we muſt take heede of them, when they are not expedient. The ſame appeareth by the practize of Paule, who abſtaineth from meates here, refraineth elſwhere from taking wages, becauſe he ſawe inconvenience in them which hindered the edifying of the Church. This hindering muſt not be paſſed over without conſideration. There are two<note n="f" place="margin">Thom. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quin. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentar. in 1. Cor. 6.

The ſecond ſcripture alleadged againſt vs, pleadeth even the practize of this Apoſtle, who yeelded (ſay they) to an inconvenience, when he purified him ſelf in the temple,
<note place="margin">Act, 12.12.</note> witnes theſe wordes, <hi>As concerning the Gentiles, we haue commaunded that no ſuch thing be obſerved.</hi> we anſwer, that which Paule did here, was thought to be convenient, becauſe nowe he is amongeſt Iewes, for the winning of whom, this his purifying is thought to be a meane and furtherance. his purifying was thought inconvenient, in regard of the Ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiles; amongſt them (therefore) he muſt not vſe it. this circumſtance mouing him to vſe it here, that he is not now amongſt them. By this meanes, that which naturally floweth from this place, maketh much for vs: to wit, that circumſtances varie the caſe, making things ſometimes convenient, at other times inconvenient: alſo that when by reaſon of circumſtances, things grow inconvenient (as the ceremonies now are growen) that then we muſt not vſe them. ſo much all reaſon doeth perſwade.

Silueſtrin. in verb. lex ſect. 8.</note> interprete the lawe, and breake the letter of it, to followe the reaſon and intent thereof. The lawe forbiddeth to open the gate of the citie: the enemie cometh vpon a ſuddaine, here neceſſitie maketh that lawfull which was not ſo before. Secondly, in the lawe of God, neceſſitie hath power to breake a ceremonie, for the performance of ſome morall duetie, even as it is ſaid, <hi>I will haue mercie rather then ſacrifice.</hi> This is the inſtance which the decretall forenamed giveth. Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie made it lawfull for the <hi>Machabies</hi> to fight on the Sabboth, which before was vnlawfull. Such is the inſtance which our Oppoſites bring likewiſe. For if <hi>Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melech</hi> doth that which is vnlawfull, it is in the breach of a ceremonie onely, to performe a morall duetie. This ſtriketh at thoſe, who for the ſacrifice, and for the ceremonie of Croſſe and Surplice, with drawe mercie and loue from vs, &amp; from poore men that are ſcandalized by them: but iuſtifieth the courſe we take, who preferre loue to the ſoules of men (being a morall duetie) before theſe ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, even as we ought. In deed, if <hi>Abimelech</hi> brake lawfully a ceremonie of God, for the good of the body, how much more (then) muſt we break theſe ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of mans commaunding, for the good of the ſoule? On the other ſide, had <hi>Abimelech</hi> ſinned, if to keepe this ceremonie he had omitted this duetie of loue to <hi>Davids</hi> body, then much more ſinne they, who to keepe theſe ceremonies of their owne, omit that duetie of edification, which they owe to their brethrens ſoules? Thirdly, the ſame <hi>Bernard</hi> that ſaith <hi>neceſsitas non habet legem,</hi> affirmeth

That we diſable not our ſelues, it hath been ſhewed elſwhere: that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing called from the preaching of the goſpell, by the violence and iniuſtice of our Reverend Fathers, no neceſſitie lyeth vpon vs, it is evident: for aſmuch as Paule ſpeaketh of them only to whom the diſpenſation is committed, and who being called thereto, doe it not willinglie through their negligence and their ſlouth: which is not our ſinne, who deſire nothing more willinglie, then to haue againe that libertie of preaching: which while we had once, we ſhewed not our ſelues ſo vnwilling and negligent, as many of our Oppoſites doe.

Somewhat is here, which toucheth our caſe.

Thus <hi>Saunders</hi> firſt. The new Goſpell hath ſo much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vayled, that there is no feare that Images ſhould be honoured too much. Thus theſe. The preaching of the Goſpell may ſo much prevayle, that the croſſe, &amp; the reſt of the ceremonies controverſed, may not be abuſed. Thus <hi>Saunders</hi> for his ſecond reaſon. The Images are often polluted with cobwebes, &amp; ſuch like ſtuffe, and ſo made vile in the eyes of the people. Thus theſe. the croſſe is a baſe thing, and of litle account in the eyes of the people, and therefore vnlikely that any wil put holines in it. Thus <hi>Saunders</hi> for his third reaſon. It is leſſe evill that ſome one ſhould doe amiſſe, then to falſifie the right of the whole lawe. Thus theſe: better that ſome be ſcandalized, then that the law of the ceremonies be repealed. Thus <hi>Saunders</hi> for his 4. reaſon. If the faith and intent be good, the worſhipping of an Image cannot be amiſſe. Thus theſe. Our vſe of the croſſe and ſurplice are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuperſtition, and the lawe intendeth a good end in them, therefore their vſe is good. Thus <hi>Sau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ders</hi> for his <hi>5.</hi> reaſon. Chriſtians now muſt not be iudged weak as were the Iewes, but ſtrong according to Iſaies propheſie, &amp; full of knowledge. Thus theſe. The people of England muſt not be iudged either weak or ignorant, as they were in time of popery to hurt themſelues with theſe old popiſh ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies. Thus <hi>Sau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ders</hi> for his ſixt reaſon. Though ſome of the people may be weak, yet it is beſt to let images alone, leaſt they ſeeke to worſe ſuperſtitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Thus theſe. The people muſt be pleaſed with Croſſe and Surplice, leaſt in diſcontent, they wiſhe for their old mumpſimus altogether. Thus <hi>Saunders</hi> for his 7. reaſon. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the people haue not the ſacrifices of the Iewes, it is fit they haue before the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Martyrs Images, who did ſacrifice their bodies. Thus theſe. The people want their old Crucifixes and wonted Images, to put them in minde of Chriſtes ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice on the croſſe, therefore the croſſe muſt ſteed them. Thus <hi>Saunders</hi> for his 8. reaſon. Images are not giuen to the people for their weaknes, but for the exerciſe of their ſtrength, and not to haue them, were puſilanimitie. Thus theſe. To feare hurt by the Croſſe and Surpliſſe were puſilanimitie. to remoue them vpon this feare a diſhonour, and to iudg the people not of ſtrength to beare them, a greater diſcredit to our Church, then it deſerueth. Thus (laſtly) <hi>Saunders</hi> for his ninth reaſon. The place of Iohn 4. which commaundeth ſpirituall worſhipping is not againſt Images, becauſe they increaſe ſpirituall deuotion. Thus theſe. The wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping of God in ſpirit and truth, not only not excludeth, but alſo requireth ſuch outward helpes of inward devotion, as are the Croſſe and Surplice. There being ſuch a neere alliance betweene theſe two diſputes, I relye on the anſwer of D. Fulke, for what he<note n="e" place="margin">D. Fulke 95.61. pag. ibid. 696.</note> ſpeaketh againſt this popiſh Magnanimitie (as he calleth it) in the vſe of the Images, that lighteth down right vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this our magnanimitie in the vſe of the Croſſe and Surpliſe. <hi>Saul</hi> denyeth in vaine to <hi>Samuel</hi> his diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, all-while the bleating of the ſheepe, &amp; the lowing of the Oxen,

Receaue theſe reaſons, and then conformitie to our ceremonies controverſed is likewiſe vnlawfull, becauſe we knowe it will harden the papiſt in his ſuperſtition: open mens mouthes to report of vs, as of turne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coates, keepe our owne brethren in their poperie ouerlong, and God will not bleſſe it in vs, eſpeciallie who cannot conforme without ſinne againſt our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences

Firſt, this was counſelled by <hi>Iames</hi> and performed by <hi>Paule,</hi> vpon a ſuppoſall the Iewes were weake, and as yet not well inſtructed in their libertie from the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of Moſes lawe: which error of theirs (as<note n="h" place="margin">Auguſt: epiſt. 19.</note>

Ceremonies (ſaith<note n="q" place="margin">Laurenc. Saund. Act &amp; Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment pag. 1494.</note> another) are ordayned for mans imperfection, ſo that popiſh ceremonies retayned, muſt needes both argue imperfection, and alſo nouriſh it. The papiſt muſt be healed like the Melancholie man, who was to beſmoothed vp a while to get credit with him, when he thought his noſe was great. howbeit ſtill to haue ſoothed him, now when credit was gotten with him, or when no credit was to be gotten at all, this had been to haue nouriſhed his conceyte, as we nowe nouriſh the conceyt of the papiſtes, in that we indeavour to pleaſe them ſtill in the vſe of theſe ceremonies, now that we ſee there is no good to be done with them. Thirdly, betweene our, and Paules conformitie, there is a difference in regard of the place. If Paule con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme him ſelf to the ceremonies of the Iewes, it is at <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> where they haue not been<note n="r" place="margin">Ioh Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uin. in Act. 21. verſ. 26</note> preached againſt, or if preached againſt at all, yet verie remiſſlie, would he haue conformed him ſelfe at<note n="s" place="margin">Ioh. Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nold. de Idololat. lib. 1. cap. 4. ſect. 18.</note> 
                           <hi>Antioch,</hi> where he him ſelf had preached againſt them, to the ſtrengthening of the Iewes in their error, and to the diſcouradging of the Gentiles, in their zeale? it appeareth by his withſtanding of <hi>Peters</hi> confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie in that place that he would not: which now is our caſe: for aſmuch as it is at <hi>Antioche</hi> that we muſt conforme our ſelues: and in thoſe very churches, where they haue been diſvſed, where we our ſelues haue preached againſt them: where the papiſt will be incouraged: the chriſtian cooled in his zeale againſt poperie. Fourthly, there is a difference in the ende: For Paule was reported to bee an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtata from the lawe, and in his<note n="t" place="margin">Auguſt. Zanch. doct willet. vb. ſuq</note> prophanes to haue condemned aſwell theſe
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:15726:142"/>rites, as he condemned the idolatries of the Gentiles: and it was to wipe away this ſcandall that he conformeth: thereby to get audience to preach vnto them. This ende of his we are onely to followe by conforming our ſelues to all good workes, thereby to defeate the imputation of profanes and looſe life, which the papiſtes obiecte vnto vs. in conforming to the ceremonies we cannot followe it, vnleſſe our governours will haue vs ſhewe by our conformitie to theſe their bad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, that it is falſe we hate their religion, and condemne it, as idolatrous. Fiftlie, there is a difference in the ſubiect, and the ſame double. Firſt, the ceremonie in which Paule conformed him ſelfe was indifferent, till the totall aboliſhing of all the reſt: whereas the croſſe we hold to be evill, which anſwere we hold by them, who whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a <hi>Nichodemite</hi> argueth, <hi>I may be preſent at maſſe aſwell as Paule in the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> give this<note n="u" place="margin">Zanch. vb. ſup pa. 492. Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum. 2.</note> replie, <hi>The maſſe and popiſh ſervice, is evill, but Paules vowe was indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent.</hi> Secondly, the ceremonie to which Paule conformed, was a morall ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie: to wit, a ceremonie of thankſgiving: it was none of them in which the Iewes placed then ſalvation: in regard whereof, it had not then<note n="w" place="margin">Ioh.

Firſt the ceremonies are the ſinewes of poperie in which they place the whole ſumme of their religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. neither is it poſſible theſe foundations of their ſuperſtitious ſtanding to keepe away from vs their ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. we ſee our Preachers are ſcarſe able to hiſſe out abuſes, when the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of abuſes are aboliſhed. nothing more light the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the fooliſh multitude, which can not be kept within the boundes of their dutie, no not when all occaſions of impietie are taken away: how much leſſe then can they be contayned, when oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion ſhall be reſtored.

                        <p>THe ſecond followeth: and it ſaith though the auncient church requireth no conformitie as neceſſarie to peace in diuers churches, yet that in one and in the ſame church it is to be required. Firſt, the Fathers did as well require a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formitie in the vniverſall church, as in any particular congregation, as hath been plainly ſhewed: and the difference about leavened and vnleavened bread was in diuerſe churches the Greeke and the Latin. yet what the Fathers ſpake againſt the neceſſitie of conformitie therein, is applied by one of our reverend writers againſt the neceſſitie of conformitie within this one church of ours. To this let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Anſelme,</hi> I haue (ſaith<note n="a" place="margin">Act. and Monu. pag 170.</note> he) adioyned an other Epiſtle of his to the ſaid <hi>Waltram:</hi> appertayning to matters not much vnlike to the ſame effect: wherein is intreated touching the varietie &amp; diuerſe vſages of the ſacraments in the church: where by ſuch as call and cry ſo much for vniformitie in the Church may note peraduenture in the ſame ſomething for their better vnderſtanding. Secondly, why ſhould diuerſitie of rites breake peace more in one church then in diuerſe, ſeeing the faith is the ſame which is affirmed to be inviolat by this diuerſitie: and diuerſitie of ceremonies is likewiſe the ſame in all places: hauing as great power beyond the ſeas to diſturbe peace, as it hath behither them? To haue peace in the church the papiſtes require an vniformitie in the languadg of Gods ſeruice,<note n="b" place="margin">Bellarmin de verb.

How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, what if the Lawe be (indeed) with vs, the violence which they offer againſt vs in this behalfe, be a violence offered againſt the very lawes them ſelues. For when the ſtatute<note n="d" place="margin">Statut. 13 Eliza. c. 12</note> requireth ſubſcription with this exception to <hi>The articles of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion which [onely]</hi> concerne the confeſſion of the true chriſtian faith &amp; the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Sacraments, the word <hi>[only]</hi> muſt needes exclude ſomewhat, which what can it be but matter of ceremonie and of Church-governement. to which the honorable ſtate of the Parliament would binde no man, becauſe they ſawe them controverſed, not only by private men, but alſo by whole churches? Now it is not vnknowne that our Reverend Fathers require a ſubſcription not only to Faith and Sacramentes, but alſo to the Diſcipline, communion booke, ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies and all things elſe, ſo impoſing articles of their owne, which no ſubiect by the lawe is permitted to doe. I ſay of their owne notwithſtanding the Canon. For ſeeing the ſtatute lawe is againſt it, no<note n="e" place="margin">Statut. 25 of H. 8. c. 19.</note> canon, no conſtitution eccleſiaſticall can make it good. Howſoever, ſeeing diverſe Miniſters haue been repelled, and deprived that offered to ſubſcribe <hi>iuxta formam Statuti,</hi> ſo farre forth as the lawe of the lande doth binde them, it ſufficiently appeareth we are denyed the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite of lawe, and that a tranſcendent power aboue the lawe hath been claymed, whereby to wrong vs. And what wil be ſaid to this, that if we were bound by the lawe to ſubſcribe as they would haue vs, that then we muſt ſubſcribe againſt the croſſe in baptiſme. For they will haue vs to ſubſcribe vnto the bookes of Homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies which are eſtabliſhed by act of Parliament, and to acknowledge no doctrine is contayned in them, but that which is ſound and true, whereas we are able to prove plainly by the principles that are contayned partly in the homilie againſt the perill of Idolatrie, partly in the homilie for Whitſentyde which handleth baptiſme, that no roome ought to be for the croſſe in the ſervice of God, or in the ſacrament of Baptiſme, as hath been ſhewed in ſeuerall places of this treatiſe. Thirdly, we complayne that we are put out from our benefices, which are free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdes, by the bare and ſole ſentence of a Biſhopp; whereas the libertie of an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh man is this, to be put from his<note n="f" place="margin">Magna Charta. c. 29.</note> free-holde by none, but by the verdict of 12. men. And as we are wronged by the bare and ſole ſentence, ſo alſo by the meere
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:15726:162"/>will and ſole pleaſure of a Biſhop. What lawe haue they elſe? For the Statute of Eliz. the 1. puniſheth no bare omiſſion with obſtinacie and contempte of any one rubric of the ſervice booke, eſpeciallie in them who receaue the whole body of it, ſo farre foorth as a booke of mans framing may be receaued. to omit that the booke for which we are puniſhed now is not that communion booke which the Statute of Eliza. doeth eſtabliſh but a newe one, a diverſe one, a different one. which when it was afferred to the moſt honorable Court of Parliament to be confirmed, it was refuſed, reiected, caſt out and diſannulled.

In all theſe we haue ſevered our ſelues from the popiſh <hi>corruptelae,</hi> falſely hiding &amp; cloaking them ſelves vnder the name of auncient cuſtomes.

Howbeit our croſſe it ſelf is dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated from auncient vſe, and is not now the ſame at this preſent which it was to the Fathers. For the firſt vſe of it amongſt the Fathers was a common croſſing <hi>ad omnem exitum &amp; aditum,</hi> which ſeeing we haue aboliſhed, we haue aboliſhed the firſt and the chiefeſt vſe to which the Fathers turned it. An other chiefe vſe of the Fathers croſſe, we will likewiſe confeſſe to be vnſeaſonable, which was to profeſſe againſt the pagans. Now condemne we the chiefeſt vſes of the Fathers, and retaine the very worſt vnder pretence of their antiquitie, this is ſtraunge doe we our ſelues aboliſh the croſſe in the tollerableſt vſes without newfanglednes, &amp; cannot our brethren omit it in the worſt, but they muſt be newfangliſtes? this is hard. Howbeit, is the vſe of it in baptiſme it ſelfe the ſame with the Fathers vſe? No, we are aſhamed even of that alſo, and haue (therefore) coyned a new vſe of our owne, which yet is litle better then theirs whereof we are aſhamed.

Secondly, the Image cannot be placed in the Church without daunger of tempting, becauſe though we worſhippe him not, yet is he worſhipped in ſundrie places nowe in our tyme: ſo is this aereall croſſe. What if he were not? For ſeeing the Homilie caſteth out of the Church of God not onely that which maketh love vnto it ſelfe, but alſo that which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth love to other things which it doeth countenance, the ſigne of the Croſſe muſt needs be caſhired, becauſe though it tempt not to ſuperſtition towardes it ſelf, yet doth it towards the Idolls of croſſes materiall, whom it reſembleth vnto the people, &amp; graceth before them. The third reaſon of the homilie, proveth the image in the church to be a tempter, in reſpect of time to come: ſuperſtitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> being an inſeperable accide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to the image that is in the church; ſo that though the croſſe aereal for the preſent did not tempt, yet there is dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger he wil ſturre &amp; raiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence in time to come Secondly, our Oppoſites themſelves will graunt that the aereall croſſe partaketh of the inwarde idolatrie as well as the materiall doth:

If the popiſhly addicted within this realme ar not in like feare to looſe the power &amp; preſence of Ch. vpon the loſſe of this ſigne, then are we gulled, not only by our owne experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, but alſo by the prudence of our Reverend Fathers which hath reſolved that it cannot be removed without a miſchief: for that the people will not miſſe it nor by any meanes leaue it: which if it be true, then even in their own co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſion they chayne it faſt with the <hi>Tyrians,</hi> clippe the winges of it from flying away with the <hi>Athenians,</hi> &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaine with the men of <hi>Sicilie</hi> in caſe it be taken from them againſt their wills.
